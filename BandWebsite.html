        <h2>Politics and ethics</h2>
        All of the group's members are vegetarians and active supporters of PETA, an animal rights organization. 
        Their video for the single "Ready to Fall" contains footage of factory farming, rodeos, and sport hunting, as well as deforestation,
         melting ice caps, and forest fires. The group has called the video the most important video they have ever made. In February 2012 the
         band released a cover of the Bob Dylan song Ballad of Hollis Brown as part of a benefit for Amnesty International.
        The Director's Cut of the video was first made available to a PETA website.[103] In 2009, the band was voted Best Animal-Friendly Band by PETA.
         In addition to being vegetarians, all the members of Rise Against, with the exception of Brandon Barnes, are straight edge; that is,
         they refrain from consuming alcohol or using drugs.

        In addition to their support of animal rights, the band has voiced their support for Democratic causes. During the 2004 United States presidential election,
         the band was part of Punkvoter, a political activist group, and appeared on the Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 compilation. The Rock Against Bush project raised over $1 million
         for then presidential candidate John Kerry. During the 2008 presidential election, the band members endorsed Barack Obama. In a news bulletin in early 2009, the band stated:
         "Few things are more exciting than watching Bush finally release America as his eight year hostage."

       <h3>Musical style and influences</h3> 
        Rise Against's musical style throughout the band's career has been described by most critics as melodic hardcore, punk rock, 
        and hardcore punk. The band has cited numerous punk and hardcore bands as influences to its music. In 2004, drummer Brandon Barnes stated:
         "I think we have a lot of different influences from hardcore like old Cave In, to a lot of punk like Face to Face, Screeching Weasel, and Down By Law."

        In 2006, Tim McIlrath stated of the band's style: "We’re emulating Minor Threat and Black Flag. Who knows, maybe if Ian MacKaye was wearing eyeliner then I would be."
         Other bands that have influenced Rise Against include Descendents, Dead Kennedys, Refused, Bad Brains, and Bad Religion.
